quickstart:

cd ~/src/afni/src
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=${PWD}/niml:${C_INCLUDE_PATH}
make 3dcalc
make 3dvolreg
make 3dFWHMx
make afni
...

Issues:
 Some features are not available (see https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857 for updates)
  1. libpython*.dylib not native (makefile does not define "LDPYTHON" but this is not used by most applications)
  2. gcc not yet available (use Clang)
  3. OpenMP not yet available
 Some libraries will need to be generated
  1. Unable to install lXpm as native library
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s libxpm
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxpm"
  2. Motif must be installed as native library
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s motif
	 Creates files in "/opt/local/include" and "/opt/local/lib"
  3. Suma requires glib must be installed as native library. This will require python3.9, which is not yet available for the M1
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s glib
	 Creates files in "/opt/local/include" and "/opt/local/lib"
  4. files in ./avovk (e.g. 3dkmeans) require gsl
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s gsl
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.6/include" and "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.6/lib"
  5. while the headers are not required to compile "vastness", AFNI wants to copy these libraries to the executable folder - perhaps they are used?	
    export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
	brew install -s freetype
    brew install -s glib
  6. brew is unable to create several libraries that the AFNI makefile wants to copy. It is unclear if these are linked to any executables:
	cp: /usr/local/lib/gcc/8/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libbz2.1.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib: No such file or directory
